# Educational Institution Management System

This project is a simple Java application created as part of university Object-Oriented Programming assignments.

## Assignment 2
In the second assignment, an object-oriented model was implemented using Java.

Main concepts:
- Abstraction using an abstract class `Person`
- Inheritance (`Student`, `Teacher`)
- Encapsulation with private fields and getters
- Polymorphism
- Data pool for storing objects with filtering, searching and sorting
- Overridden `toString()`, `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods

## Assignment 3
In the third assignment, database functionality was added.

Features:
- PostgreSQL database
- Two tables: `students` and `teachers`
- JDBC connection
- Basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)

Database interaction is demonstrated separately without modifying the existing object-oriented model.

## Technologies
- Java
- PostgreSQL
- JDBC
- IntelliJ IDEA

## How to run
1. Create a PostgreSQL database named `university`
2. Create tables `students` and `teachers`
3. Update database credentials in `DatabaseConnection.java`
4. Run the database demo class
